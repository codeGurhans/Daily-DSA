## ‚úÖ DSA Question: String isSubsequence

## üß† Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, check if `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

A string s is a subsequence of t if s can be derived from t by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

---

## Examples:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc" ‚Üí Output: true

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc" ‚Üí Output: false

# Approach
To check if s is a subsequence of t, we can use the two pointers method:

## **Steps**

1. Initialize two pointers: i = 0 for s and j = 0 for t.
2. Traverse t using pointer j:
   * If s[i] == t[j], move pointer i to the next character in s.
   * Always move pointer j to the next character in t.
3. After traversal, if i equals the length of s, then s is a subsequence of t.
4. Otherwise, s is not a subsequence.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) ‚Äî where n is the length of string `t`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) ‚Äî constant space usage, no extra memory.
